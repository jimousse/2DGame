# JavaScript Game
This is a simple tile-based game concept made in JavaScript using HTML5 `<canvas>`.

## Demo
https://jimousse.github.io/2DGame/

## What I used
I used [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) to create 
- the overvall html element that  contains the canvas and start the game
- the speech bubbles
- the on-screen directional controller

What runs in the canvas is made only with Javascript using ES6 features.

## Assets
### The character, the cats and the world
I designed all that using GIMP. The character is based on me ðŸ˜›.
### The coins
